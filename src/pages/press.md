# Project overview
The goal of Mutual Aid SD is to match independent San Diego-based restaurants with volunteers providing free digital marketing services. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced independent San Diego-based restaurants to suddenly shift how they reach their customers. Many are going digital for the first time and/or integrating new tools to grow their capacity. This puts digital marketing experts in a unique position to help.

## Why restaurants?
1. Small, independent restaurants, and food service workers they employ, are vital to San Diego’s food culture. It’s also an industry that most of us love and are somewhat familiar with. So, it seemed like the right place to start.
2. Starting with a narrow focus will help us work out any kinks in our service model and scale with purpose. As our volunteer base and capabilities grow, we’ll consider expanding to include other types of local businesses.
