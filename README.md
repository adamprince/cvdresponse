# Project description

The goal of [Mutual Aid SD](https://mutualaidsd.com/) is to match independent San Diego-based restaurants with volunteers providing **free** digital marketing services.

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced independent San Diego-based restaurants to suddenly shift how they reach their customers. Many are going digital for the first time and/or integrating new tools to grow their capacity. This puts digital marketing experts in a unique position to help.

## Why restaurants?
1. Small, independent restaurants (and service workers) are a vital part of our local food culture. It’s also an industry that most of us love and are somewhat familiar with. So, it seemed like the right place to start.
2. Starting with a narrow focus will help us work out any kinks in our service model and scale with purpose. As our capacity grows, we’ll consider expanding to include other types of local businesses.

## Get involved

We could use some help in the following areas:

### Help spread the word

One of our biggest challenges is getting the word out. We'd be stoked if you could share our project on social media.

Note: At the moment, we're only able to serve independent **San Diego-based** restaurants.

### Volunteer

We are seeking volunteers in the following areas:

- Social
- Copywriting
- Web design/development
- Digital strategy
- Content creation (photo, video, etc.)
- eCommerce
- PR/media
